[[minishift-ci-overview]]
== Overview

Minishift uses the following CI build systems: CentOS CI, AppVeyor, Circle CI, and Travis CI.
These systems build the master branch when a commit occurs as well as the incoming pull requests.
Except for Travis CI, they also archive build artifacts.

|CentOS CI is the only CI system which can run integration tests, as it supports nested virtualization.
Thus it is used to run integration tests in addition to unit tests.

The artifacts of a successful master build can be found at link:http://artifacts.ci.centos.org/minishift/minishift/master/[artifacts.ci.centos.org/minishift/minishift/master/<BUILD_ID>].
The artifacts of a successful pull request build can be found at link:http://artifacts.ci.centos.org/minishift/minishift/pr/[artifacts.ci.centos.org/minishift/minishift/pr/<PR_ID>].

On top of building the master branch and pull requests, CentOS CI is also used to build the tar bundle used for xref:../contributing/writing-docs.adoc#integration-with-docs-openshift-org[integration with docs.openshift.org], as well as to build xref:../contributing/releasing.adoc#automated-release[releases].
