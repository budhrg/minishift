[[releasing-overview]]
== Overview

The following sections describe how to release Minishift either via automated job or manually.

[[preparing-github-milestone]]
== Preparing the GitHub Milestone

. Verify the milestone you want to release:
  - Move remaining open issues into the next milestone.
  - Review resolved/closed issues and make sure they are classified correctly.
  - Check and update the resolution of the issues.
  For example, issues with a merged pull requests should be labeled as *resolution/done*.
. Close milestone.

[[auto-release]]
== Automated Release

An automated release can be performed by:

----
$ API_KEY=<api-key> RELEASE_VERSION=<version> make ci_release
----

where

  - `api-key` : Minishift CentOS CI API key
  - `version` : Expected release version. Eg : 1.0.0 (without 'v')

In case, you are not able to trigger the job via command line, try running link:https://ci.centos.org/job/minishift-release[release build] by passing required `RELEASE_VERSION` information.

The automated release perform:

- xref:cut-release[Cutting the Release]
- xref:trigger-docs-build[Trigger the documentation build]
- xref:post-release-tasks[Perform Post-Release Tasks]

[[manaul-release]]
== Manual Release

[[release-prereqs]]
=== Prerequisites

- You must have a https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use[GitHub personal access token]
defined in your environment as _GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN_.

[[cut-release]]
=== Cutting the Release

. Run the required checks:
+
----
$ make prerelease
----

. Bump the Minishift version in the link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift/blob/master/Makefile[Makefile].

. Commit and push your changes with a message of the form `cut v1.0.0`.

. Create binaries and upload them to GitHub (this will also tag the release):
+
----
$ make release
----

[[trigger-docs-build]]
=== Trigger the documentation build

----
$ export API_KEY=<api-key>
$ curl -H "$(curl --user minishift:$API_KEY 'https://ci.centos.org//crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,":",//crumb)')" -X POST https://ci.centos.org/job/minishift-docs/build --user "minishift:$API_KEY"
----

This will build link:http://artifacts.ci.centos.org/minishift/minishift/docs/latest/[minishift-adoc.tar], which will be consumed by *docs.openshift.org* during the next nightly build.
For more information, see xref:../contributing/writing-docs.adoc#[Writing and Publishing Minishift Documentation].

[[post-release-tasks]]
=== Post-Release Tasks

As part of the release process we also send a release announcement and edit the GitHub release page.

For the latter we usually add a categorized list of closed issues as well as some release highlights (most often taken from the release announcement).

If you have link:https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] installed on your machine, you can use the link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift/blob/master/scripts/release/issue-list.sh[issue-list.sh] script to generate the markdown needed for adding the issue list.
For example:

----
$ cd scripts/release
$ ./issue-list.sh -r minishift -m 9
----
